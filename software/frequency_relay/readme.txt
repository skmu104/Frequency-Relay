DESCRIPTION:
Program that operates as a frequency relay

The memory footprint of this hosted application is intended to be small (under 100 kbytes) by default
using a standard reference deisgn.


PERIPHERALS USED:
This uses following peripherals:
- STDOUT device (UART or JTAG UART)

BOARD/HOST REQUIREMENTS:
This example requires only a JTAG connection with a Nios Development board. If
the host communication settings are changed from JTAG UART (default) to use a
conventional UART, a serial cable between board DB-9 connector  and the host is
required.
